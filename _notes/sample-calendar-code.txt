this may help with time zones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

BUGS/TO-DO LIST:
* make sure time zones that are ahead of GMT work
* early morning start time and late end time forces google to have start date in gcal to come before end date
* If time object is HTML5 only then you might have to say this only works in FF or Chrome or IE or Edge or Safari versions x.x and later
* add labels for req'd fields and error handling for unfilled in fields
* add copy button next to output boxes
* add comments to explain all your code
